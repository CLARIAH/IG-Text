# CLARIAH Interest Group on Text

This repository is intended to organize the work, output and documentation of the CLARIAH Interest Group (IG) on Text
Processing.

## Introduction

There is a CLARIAH-wide need for robust text processing technologies that can handle historical as well as contemporary
Dutch texts. Partners like VU, INT and RU have contributed different components in WP3 and WP6.

## Aims of the Interest Group

The aims of the IG on Text are:

- foster discussion and knowledge sharing regarding text processing
- enhance interoperability between various text processing solutions
- develop and share best practices
- inform development of CLARIAH text processing tools and services

## Scope of the Interest Group

- support of automatic text processing, including but not limited to linguistic enrichment and NLP

Aspects that are outside the scope of this Interest Group (because they are covered by other IGs):

- manual text annotation (covered by the [annotation group](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-Annotation))
- annotation models and formats (covered by the [annotation group](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-Annotation))

## Communication

We use the following communication channel:

- slack (to be announced)

## Tasks

Text processing problems that we try to tackle are:

- automatic linguistic enrichment for multiple languages and multiple time periods
    - named entity extraction
    - dependency relations
    - part-of-speech tagging
    - lemmatisation
    - sentiment analysis
- text normalisation (including post-OCR/HTR correction)
- interoperability
- choosing standards
- ... (todo)

## Group Members

- Hennie Brugman (KNAW Humanities Cluster)
- Roeland Ordelman (Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision)
- Martin Reynaert (DCA - Tilburg University / ILLC - Universiteit van Amsterdam)

The group is open to new members.
